        <h2>Idlenet (TBD)</h2>
        <p>'Idlenet' is an incremental game that is currently in development. It's about managing a growing network, is set in an alternate present, and will most definitely not be accurate. I consider it my first &quot;proper&quot; game, made with the LÃ–VE framework in Lua. Heavily inspired by the games <i>Kittens Game</i>, <i>Bitburner</i>, <i>Trimps</i>, <i>Your Chronicle</i>, <i>Orb of Creation</i>, and <i>Idling to Rule the Gods</i>. It'll be released on Windows, Linux, and macOS first through itch.io and eventually Steam once it is fully cooked. The game's source code will also &quot;soon&quot; be available on sourcehut.</p>

        <h2>Crackhead Jack: Overdose Edition (2020)</h2>
        <p>'The Adventures of Crackhead Jack' is a game I made with RPG Maker VXAce in 2016, released for free on <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/the-adventures-of-crackhead-jack/148303">GameJolt</a>. You play as a man named Jack who is joined by two cultists to get back his crack that was taken by the police. It is a short and mechanically simple RPG filled with inside jokes and secret references, originally made as a <i>South Park</i>-esque parody of Vinesauce Joel's <i>BBQ Quest</i>. The <i>Cyanide & Happiness</i> style graphics are made by hand with a mouse and shitty used Wacom tablet in Paint.NET.</p> 
        <p>In 2020 I <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1328500/">updated and re-released the game on Steam</a> as the <b>Overdose Edition</b>, featuring a gameplay balance overhaul and a story rewrite after I tried out drugs. It's $5, and also has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1440820/The_Adventures_of_Crackhead_Jack_Overdose_Edition_Soundtrack/">an original soundtrack</a> thanks to some very talented friends &mdash; they get the soundtrack sales.</p>

                &quot;I like pretty much all of this game and would recommend it to anyone looking for some dumb fun.&quot;

                &quot;Alright highkey I had a blast playing this game and I've been saying to everyone that its legit the best game I've ever spent 5 dollars on.&quot;

                &quot;This game is a hidden gem. I found it completely by accident and i'm glad that I did. I always love stupid games like this and i'm shocked this one isn't more well known. If you enjoy stupid/funny games I Highly recommend.&quot;

                &quot;The Adventures of Crackhead Jack looks like a gimmicky joke game but it's actually a really solid RPG. The sense of humor is pretty dumb at times but dumb in the kind of way that makes you CRACK a smile.&quot;

            <p>
                &quot;Crackhead Jack is exhilarating. It's like I can really feel the rocks in my nose while I'm playing. That or I'm actually on the powder. Either or, this game should be free in Venezuela and Colombia; easy access and all that.&quot;

        <h2>GameJolt garbage (2013-2015)</h2>
        <p>I made a bunch of shitty small unfinished games that I released on GameJolt while I was in middle school. They're made with the GameMaker Language in GameMaker Studio 1.4. They're not really worth talking about &mdash; two barebones idle games and an unfinished platformer. Link <a href="https://vfjekgd.gamejolt.io/games.html">here.</a></p>
